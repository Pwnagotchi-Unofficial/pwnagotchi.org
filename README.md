# Ideas about pwnagotchi.org
My main plan about pwnagotchi.org is to use it to point to different use cases. Different people could host a web front end to their application using a subdomain (An application like opwngrid.xyz). It would be cool to have subdomains for WIKI's on your plugins/ideas.
# Mailing me about reserving a subdomain.
You can email me at dylan@dylanjava.com about reserving a subdomain. If you use something like Cloudflare Tunnels or the Cloudflare DDNS program email me about that (as it would require different setup).
# How to add my project to the list.
There are two ways:

The Easy way

1. Email me about your project if its not already at the list.

Or the harder way

2. Submit a patchset. You can watch [this video](https://spacepub.space/w/ad258d23-0ac6-488c-83fc-2bacf578de3a) by Drew Devault (creator of sr.ht) about how to do this.
